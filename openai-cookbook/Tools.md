## Tools

- The WebSearchTool lets an agent search the web.
- The FileSearchTool allows retrieving information from your OpenAI Vector Stores.
- The ComputerTool allows automating computer use tasks.
- The CodeInterpreterTool lets the LLM execute code in a sandboxed environment.
- The HostedMCPTool exposes a remote MCP server's tools to the model.
- The ImageGenerationTool generates images from a prompt.
- The LocalShellTool runs shell commands on your machine.

```python
from agents import Agent, FileSearchTool, Runner, WebSearchTool

agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    tools=[
        WebSearchTool(),
        FileSearchTool(
            max_num_results=3,
            vector_store_ids=["VECTOR_STORE_ID"],
        ),
    ],
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Which coffee shop should I go to, taking into account my preferences and the weather today in SF?")
    print(result.final_output)
```

```python
import json

from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Any

from agents import Agent, FunctionTool, RunContextWrapper, function_tool


class Location(TypedDict):
    lat: float
    long: float

@function_tool  
async def fetch_weather(location: Location) -> str:
    
    """Fetch the weather for a given location.

    Args:
        location: The location to fetch the weather for.
    """
    # In real life, we'd fetch the weather from a weather API
    return "sunny"


@function_tool(name_override="fetch_data")  
def read_file(ctx: RunContextWrapper[Any], path: str, directory: str | None = None) -> str:
    """Read the contents of a file.

    Args:
        path: The path to the file to read.
        directory: The directory to read the file from.
    """
    # In real life, we'd read the file from the file system
    return "<file contents>"


agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    tools=[fetch_weather, read_file],  
)

for tool in agent.tools:
    if isinstance(tool, FunctionTool):
        print(tool.name)
        print(tool.description)
        print(json.dumps(tool.params_json_schema, indent=2))
        print()
```

## Agent as tools

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
import asyncio

spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="Spanish agent",
    instructions="You translate the user's message to Spanish",
)

french_agent = Agent(
    name="French agent",
    instructions="You translate the user's message to French",
)

orchestrator_agent = Agent(
    name="orchestrator_agent",
    instructions=(
        "You are a translation agent. You use the tools given to you to translate."
        "If asked for multiple translations, you call the relevant tools."
    ),
    tools=[
        spanish_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="translate_to_spanish",
            tool_description="Translate the user's message to Spanish",
        ),
        french_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="translate_to_french",
            tool_description="Translate the user's message to French",
        ),
    ],
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(orchestrator_agent, input="Say 'Hello, how are you?' in Spanish.")
    print(result.final_output)
```

## Conditional tool enabling
You can conditionally enable or disable agent tools at runtime using the is_enabled parameter. This allows you to dynamically filter which tools are available to the LLM based on context, user preferences, or runtime conditions.

```
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, AgentBase, Runner, RunContextWrapper
from pydantic import BaseModel

class LanguageContext(BaseModel):
    language_preference: str = "french_spanish"

def french_enabled(ctx: RunContextWrapper[LanguageContext], agent: AgentBase) -> bool:
    """Enable French for French+Spanish preference."""
    return ctx.context.language_preference == "french_spanish"

# Create specialized agents
spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="spanish_agent",
    instructions="You respond in Spanish. Always reply to the user's question in Spanish.",
)

french_agent = Agent(
    name="french_agent",
    instructions="You respond in French. Always reply to the user's question in French.",
)

# Create orchestrator with conditional tools
orchestrator = Agent(
    name="orchestrator",
    instructions=(
        "You are a multilingual assistant. You use the tools given to you to respond to users. "
        "You must call ALL available tools to provide responses in different languages. "
        "You never respond in languages yourself, you always use the provided tools."
    ),
    tools=[
        spanish_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="respond_spanish",
            tool_description="Respond to the user's question in Spanish",
            is_enabled=True,  # Always enabled
        ),
        french_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="respond_french",
            tool_description="Respond to the user's question in French",
            is_enabled=french_enabled,
        ),
    ],
)

async def main():
    context = RunContextWrapper(LanguageContext(language_preference="french_spanish"))
    result = await Runner.run(orchestrator, "How are you?", context=context.context)
    print(result.final_output)

asyncio.run(main())
```
